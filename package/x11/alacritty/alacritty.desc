[I] The fastest terminal emulator in existence

[T] Alacritty is a terminal emulator with a strong focus on simplicity

[T] that simply aren't possible without it. With such a strong focus on
[T] performance, included features are carefully considered and you can
[T] always expect Alacritty to be blazingly fast.
