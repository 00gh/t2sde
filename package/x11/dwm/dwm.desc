[I] A dynamic window manager for X11

[T] Dwm is a fast and simple window manager for X11. It manages windows in
[T] tiled and floating layouts. Either layout can be applied dynamically,
[T] optimizing the environment for the application in use and the task
[T] performed. Windows can be tagged with one or multiple tags. Selecting
[T] certain tags displays all windows that are accordingly tagged. dwm is
[T] the little brother of wmii.
