[I] A file manager for the X Window System

[T] X File Explorer (Xfe) is a filemanager for X. It is based on the
[T] popular, but discontinued, X Win Commander. Xfe is desktop independent
[T] and is written with the C++ Fox Toolkit. It looks similar to Windows
[T] Commander or MS-Explorer, and is very fast and simple. It features file
[T] associations, the ability to mount/umount devices, a directory tree for
[T] quickly changing directories, the ability to change file attributes,
[T] automatic registry saving, the ability to view/create/extract compressed
[T] archives, and much more.
