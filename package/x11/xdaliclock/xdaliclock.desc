[I] A digital clock for the X Window System

[T] XDaliClock is a digital clock for the X Window System; when a digit changes, it
[T] ``melts'' into its new shape. It can display in 12 or 24 hour modes, and
[T] displays the date when a mouse button is held down. It has two large fonts
[T] built into it, but it can animate most other fonts that contain all of the
[T] digits. It can also do some funky psychedelic colormap cycling, and can use
[T] overlay planes or the `shape' extension so that the window is transparent.
