[I] Pop up a window of text, auto-sized and centered on the screen

[T] yaf-splash pops up a window of text, auto-sized and centered on the
[T] screen, that is dismissed when you click on it, rather like xmessage.
[T] Unlike xmessage, it lacks buttons and other window manager cruft, can
[T] appear transparent via the SHAPE extension, or overlays if your xserver
[T] supports them, and has a bunch of other configuration options.
