[I] Glipper-Lite is a clipboard manager

[T] Glipper-Lite is a clipboard manager similar to KDE's Klipper, or Ditto for
[T] Windows. It is an old-fashioned system tray icon which provides a history
[T] of text copied to the X11 clipboard and primary selection.
[T] Glipper-Lite only depends on GTK+ 2 and NOT on GNOME libs, so you can also
[T] use it with any other window manager or panel that supports tray icons.
[T] This is a continuation of the classic C version of Glipper. The original
[T] Glipper project moved to Python long ago
