[I] A graphical user interface for managing and running SSH

[T] SecPanel sits on top of SSH software-suites and supports the SSH.com and the
[T] OpenSSH-version. You may get information about these programs at
[T] http://www.ssh.com respectively at http://www.openssh.com.
[T] SecPanel is written entirely in pure Tcl/Tk and does not need any
[T] extensions but it requires version 8.x of Tcl and Tk.
