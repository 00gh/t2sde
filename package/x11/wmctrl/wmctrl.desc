[I] Command line tool to interact with Window Managers

[T] The wmctrl program is a UNIX/Linux command line tool to interact
[T] with an EWMH/NetWM compatible X Window Manager.
[T]
[T] It provides command line access to almost all features defined in
[T] the EWMH specification. It can be used, for example, to obtain
[T] information about the window manager, to get a detailed list of
[T] desktops and managed windows, to switch and resize desktops, to
[T] make windows full-screen, always-above or sticky, and to activate,
[T] close, move, resize, maximize and minimize them.
[T]
[T] The command line access to these window management functions makes
[T] it easy to automate and execute them from any application that is
[T] able to run a command in response to some event.
