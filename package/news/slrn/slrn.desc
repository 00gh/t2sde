[I] A console news reader

[T] A console S-Lang based newsreader that supports scoring and is highly
[T] customizable. Allows free key-bindings and can be easily extended
[T] using s-lang macro language. Offline reading is possible by using
[T] either slrnpull (shipped with SLRN) or a local newserver like LeafNode
[T] or INN. This ext file builds the optional slrnpull.
