[I] EXtensible Multi-Dimensional Simulator

[T] XMDS is a code generator that integrates equations. You write them
[T] down in human readable form in an XML file, and it goes away and
[T] writes and compiles a C++ program that integrates those equations as
[T] fast as it can possibly be done in your architecture.
