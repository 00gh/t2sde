[I] Interactive theorem prover

[T] The Rocq Prover is an interactive theorem prover, or proof assistant.
[T] This means that it is designed to develop mathematical proofs,
[T] and especially to write formal specifications: programs and proofs that
[T] programs comply to their specifications.
[T]
[T] An interesting additional feature of Rocq is that it can automatically
[T] extract executable programs from specifications, as either OCaml or
[T] Haskell source code.
