[I] Multiple-precision floating-point computations with exact rounding

[T] The MPFR library is a C library for multiple-precision floating-point
[T] computations with exact rounding (also called correct rounding). It is
[T] based on the GMP multiple-precision library. The main goal of MPFR is
[T] to provide a library for multiple-precision floating-point computation
[T] which is both efficient and has well-defined semantics. It copies the good
[T] ideas from the ANSI/IEEE-754 standard for double-precision floating-point
[T] arithmetic (53-bit mantissa).
