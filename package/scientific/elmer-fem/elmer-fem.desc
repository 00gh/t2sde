[I] Finite Element Software for Multiphysical Problems

[T] Elmer is a computational tool for multi-physics problems that has been
[T] developed in collaboration with Finnish universities, research
[T] laboratories and industry. It includes physical models of fluid
[T] dynamics, structural mechanics, electromagnetics, and heat
[T] transfer. These are described by partial differential equations which
[T] are solved by the Finite Element Method (FEM). It comprises of several
[T] different parts. The geometry, boundary conditions and physical models
[T] are defined in ElmerFront. The resulting problem definition is solved
[T] by ElmerSolver. Results are the visualized by ElmerPost. An ElmerGrid
[T] utility may be used for simple mesh manipulation.
