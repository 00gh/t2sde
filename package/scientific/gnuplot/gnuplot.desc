[I] The GNU Plotting Utility

[T] Gnuplot is a command-line driven interactive function plotting utility.
[T] It was originally intended as graphical program which would allow
[T] scientists and students to visualize mathematical functions and data.
[T] Gnuplot supports many different types of terminals, plotters, and
[T] printers (including many color devices, and pseudo-devices like LaTeX)
[T] and is easily extensible to include new devices.
