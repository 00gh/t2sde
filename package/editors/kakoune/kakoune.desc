[I] Visual text editor inspired by vim with fewer keystrokes

[T] Kakoune is a code editor that implements Vi's "keystrokes as a text editing
[T] language" model. As it's also a modal editor, it is somewhat similar to the
[T] Vim editor (after which Kakoune was originally inspired).
[T] 
[T] Kakoune has a strong focus on interactivity, most commands provide immediate
[T] and incremental results, while still being competitive (as in keystroke count)
[T] with Vim.
[T]
[T] Kakoune works on selections, which are oriented, inclusive range of characters,
[T] selections have an anchor and a cursor character. Most commands move both of
[T] them, except when extending selection where the anchor character stays fixed
[T] and the cursor one moves around.
