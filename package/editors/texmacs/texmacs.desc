[I] A structured "wysiwyg" technical text editor

[T] GNU TeXmacs is a free scientific text editor, which was inspired
[T] by both TeX and GNU Emacs. The editor allows you to write structured
[T] documents via a "wysiwyg" and user friendly interface. The program
[T] implements high quality typesetting algorithms and TeX fonts. It is
[T] also possible to use TeXmacs as an interface to computer algebra
[T] systems. Finally, TeXmacs supports the Guile/Scheme extension
[T] language, which makes it possible to adapt the user interface to
[T] specific needs, and even to extend the editor.
