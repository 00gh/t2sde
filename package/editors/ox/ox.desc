[I] The simple but flexible text editor

[T] Ox is a text editor that can be used to write everything from text to code.
[T] It runs in your terminal as a text-user-interface, just like vim, nano and
[T] micro, however, it is not based on any existing editors and has been built
[T] from the ground up.
