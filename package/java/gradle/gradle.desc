[T] A build tool with a focus on build automation and support for 
[T] multi-language development. If you are building, testing, publishing, and 
[T] deploying software on any platform, Gradle offers a flexible model that 
[T] can support the entire development lifecycle from compiling and packaging 
[T] code to publishing web sites. Gradle has been designed to support build 
[T] automation across multiple languages and platforms including Java, Scala, 
[T] Android, Kotlin, C/C++, and Groovy, and is closely integrated with 
[T] development tools and continuous integration servers including Eclipse, 
[T] IntelliJ, and Jenkins.
