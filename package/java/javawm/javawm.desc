[I] A new, small Java Virtual Machine conforming to the JVM specification

[T] JamVM is a new Java Virtual Machine which conforms to the JVM
[T] specification version 2 (blue book). In comparison to most other VM's
[T] (free and commercial) it is extremely small, with a stripped executable
[T] on PowerPC of only ~160K, and Intel 140K. However, unlike other small
[T] VMs (e.g. KVM) it is designed to support the full specification, and
[T] includes support for object finalisation, Soft/Weak/Phantom References,
[T] class-unloading, the Java Native Interface (JNI) and the Reflection API.
