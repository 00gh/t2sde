[I] System daemon for power-management on PowerPC systems

[T] pmud is a system daemon, which is useful only for Apple Macintosh
[T] Powerbooks.

[T] It constantly checks the Powermanagement unit to see if there is enough
[T] power left to continue. If power runs short, it will put the machine
[T] to sleep.
