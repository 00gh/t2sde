[I] DVD Authoring Tools

[T] dvdauthor is a program that will generate a DVD movie from a valid
[T] mpeg2 stream that should play when you put it in a DVD player.
[T] The idea is to be able to create menus, buttons, chapters, etc, but for
[T] now you can just take an mpeg stream (as created by mplex -f 8 from
[T] mjpegtools 1.6.0) and write it to DVD.
