[I] Direct framebuffer access library - fork of DirectFB

[T] DirectFB2 is the successor of DirectFB, providing a thin library that
[T] provides hardware graphics acceleration, input device handling and
[T] abstraction, integrated windowing system with support for translucent
[T] windows and multiple display layers on top of the Linux Framebuffer Device.
[T] It is a complete hardware abstraction layer with software fallbacks for
[T] every graphics operation that is not supported by the underlying hardware.
[T] DirectFB2 adds graphical power to embedded systems and sets a new standard
[T] for graphics under Linux.
