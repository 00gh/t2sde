[I] Library for the .mkv video format

[T] Matroska aims to become THE Standard of Multimedia Container Formats. It
[T] was derived from a project called MCF, but differentiates from it
[T] significantly because it is based on EBML (Extensible Binary Meta
[T] Language), a binary derivative of XML. EBML enables the
[T] Matroska Development Team to gain significant advantages in terms of
[T] future format extensibility, without breaking file support in old
[T] parsers.
