[I] Free flash movie player

[T] Gnash is originally based on the code of GameSWF, by Thatcher
[T] Ulrich. GameSWF is the most advanced of the free flash movie player
[T] projects, and implements a fairly broad set of Flash Format v7
[T] compliance. GameSWF was unsupported public domain software though,
[T] and not really setup to be an industrial strength project that could
[T] be used by everyone that uses Firefox.
[T] So in early December of 2005, GameSWF was forked, and the code
[T] rearranged in GNU project style.
