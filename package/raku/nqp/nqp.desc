[I] Not Quite Perl

[T] A lightweight Raku-like environment for virtual machines. The key feature of
[T] NQP is that it's designed to be a very small environment (as compared with,
[T] say, raku or Rakudo) and is focused on being a high-level way to create
[T] compilers and libraries for virtual machines like MoarVM [1], the JVM, and
[T] others.
