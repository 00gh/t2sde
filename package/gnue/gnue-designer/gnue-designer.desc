[I] IDE for the GNUe tools

[T] GNUe Designer is the IDE for the GNUe tools. It allows you to visually
[T] layout your forms in a RAD-style environment. Designer has a builtin forms
[T] client, so you can quickly test your forms while still in Designer.
[T] Designer also has support for form creation wizards... answer a few
[T] questions, attach your form to one or more database tables, select the
[T] fields to include, and, voila, a basic form is created. Basic support for
[T] schema creation is also included.
