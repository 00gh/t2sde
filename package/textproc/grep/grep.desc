[I] This is GNU grep, the "fastest grep in the west"

[T] GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher
[T] (about twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a
[T] Boyer-Moore-Gosper search for a fixed string that eliminates
[T] impossible text from being considered by the full regexp
[T] matcher without necessarily having to look at every character. The
[T] result is typically many times faster than Unix grep or
[T] egrep.
