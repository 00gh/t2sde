[I] A library to convert between character sets and usages

[T] The library recognises or produces nearly 150 different character sets
[T] and is able to transliterate files between almost any pair. When exact
[T] transliteration are not possible, it may get rid of the offending
[T] characters or fall back on approximations. Most RFC 1345 character sets
[T] are supported. The 'recode' program is a handy front-end to the library.
