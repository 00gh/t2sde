[I] The simple GObject game controller library

[T] libmanette offers painless access to game controllers, from any programming
[T] language and with little dependencies.
[T] It supports the de-facto standard gamepad, as defined by the W3C standard
[T] gamepad specification or as implemented by the SDL GameController.
[T] Convertion of raw gamepad events into usable ones is handled transparently
[T] using an embedded library of mappings in the popular SDL mapping string
[T] format.
