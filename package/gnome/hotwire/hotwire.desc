[I] A replacement for the interactive command execution portion of a Unix shell

[T] Hotwire is intended to replace the interactive command execution portion
[T] of a typical Unix shell. It includes much of the functionality found in
[T] the combination of a terminal emulator, a shell, and core utilities like
[T] ls and grep. Most of the commands are named the same, and do basically
[T] the same thing. Where it makes sense, Hotwire improves the commands to
[T] have better defaults and makes things nicer by using the mouse, and so
[T] on. For example, rm moves files to ~/. Trash on Unix and Recycle Bin
[T] on Windows, cd automatically lists the contents of the directory you
[T] change to, ls links are clickable (view file or cd to directory), filter
[T] (analogous to Unix grep) shows matching text in bold, and the ps process
[T] list has right-click menu for killing.
