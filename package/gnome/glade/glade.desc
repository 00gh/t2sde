[I] GTK+ interface builder v2

[T] Glade is a GUI builder suite using GTK+ and GNOME. It stores
[T] projects in XML-like plain ASCII format and can generate C
[T] code of this meta-format. Additionally, the meta-format can be
[T] converted to other languages via modules. For example, glade--
[T] can generate C++ code.
