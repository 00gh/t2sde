[I] System and Service Manager

[T] systemd is a suite of basic building blocks for a Linux system. systemd
[T] provides aggressive parallelization capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus
[T] activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting of daemons,
[T] keeps track of processes using Linux control groups, maintains mount and
[T] automount points, and implements an elaborate transactional
[T] dependency-based service control logic.
