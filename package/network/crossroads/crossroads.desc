[I] Crossroads Load Balancer and Fail Over Utility

[T] Crossroads is an open source load balance and fail over utility
[T] for TCP based services. It is a daemon running in user space,
[T] and features extensive configurability, polling of back ends
[T] using 'wakeup calls', deatailed status reporting, 'hooks' for
[T] special actions when backend calls fail, and much more.
[T] Crossroads is service-independent: it is usable for HTTP(S), SSH,
[T] SMTP, DNS, etc.. In the case of HTTP balancing, Crossroads can
[T] provide 'session stickiness' for back end processes that need sessions,
[T] but aren't session-aware of other back ends.
