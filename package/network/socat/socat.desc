[I] "netcat++" (extended design, new implementation)

[T] socat is a relay for bidirectional data transfer between two independent data
[T] channels. Each of these data channels may be a file, pipe, device (serial line
[T] etc. or a pseudo terminal), a socket (UNIX, IP4, IP6 - raw, UDP, TCP), an
[T] SSL socket, proxy CONNECT connection, a file descriptor (stdin etc.), the GNU
[T] line editor (readline), a program, or a combination of two of these.
[T] These modes include generation of "listening" sockets, named pipes, and pseudo
[T] terminals.
