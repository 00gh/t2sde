[T] Cryptcat is the standard netcat enhanced with twofish encryption with ports for
[T] WIndows NT, BSD and Linux. Twofish is courtesy of counterpane, and cryptix.
[T]
[T] TCP/IP swiss army knife extended with twofish encryption - Cryptcat is a simple
[T] Unix utility which reads and writes data across network connections, using TCP
[T] or UDP protocol while encrypting the data being transmitted. It is designed to
[T] be a reliable "back-end" tool that can be used directly or easily driven by
[T] other programs and scripts. At the same time, it is a feature-rich network
[T] debugging and exploration tool, since it can create almost any kind of
[T] connection you would need and has several interesting built-in capabilities.
