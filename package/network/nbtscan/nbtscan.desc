[I] Scans for open NETBIOS nameservers on a local or remote TCP/IP network

[T] This is a command-line tool that scans for open NETBIOS nameservers on a
[T] local or remote TCP/IP network, and this is a first step in finding of
[T] open shares. It is based on the functionality of the standard Windows tool
[T] nbtstat, but it operates on a range of addresses instead of just one.
