[I] Software which extends the functions of Asterisk with end-user Web clients

[T] astGUIclient is part of a suite of programs that are designed to
[T] interact with the Asterisk PBX Phone system at a client computer
[T] level to extend the functionality of your phone and system. The
[T] main GUI application, astGUIclient, is a set of PHP Web-based
[T] scripts utilizing Javascript and XMLHTTPRequest functions
[T] that work through a browser to give realtime information and
[T] functionality with nothing more than an Internet browser on the
[T] client computer. Another component included with the astGUIclient
[T] package is the VICIDIAL auto-dialer, a list dialer which can
[T] dial one-call-at-a-time or be put in auto-dial mode to act as
[T] a predictive dialer. It can function as an ACD for inbound calls
[T] or for Closer calls coming from VICIDIAL fronters, and allows
[T] for remote agents that may only have a phone.
