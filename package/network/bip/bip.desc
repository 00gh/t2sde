[I] An IRC proxy

[T] Bip is an IRC proxy, which means it keeps connected to your
[T] preferred IRC servers, can store the logs for you, and even
[T] send them back to your IRC client(s) upon connection. You may
[T] want to use bip to keep your logfiles (in a unique format and
[T] on a unique computer) whatever your client is, when you connect
[T] from multiple workstations, or when you simply want to have a
[T] playback of what was said while you were away.
