[I] Listens to a GPS and provides clients with the data

[T] Gpsd is a daemon that listens to a GPS or Loran receiver and translates
[T] the positional data into a simplified format that can be more easily used
[T] by other programs, like chart plotters. The package comes with a sample
[T] client that plots the location of the currently visible GPS satellites
[T] (if available) and a speedometer. It can also use DGPS/ip.
