[I] A system statistics collection daemon

[T] Collectd is a small daemon which collects system information every 10
[T] seconds and writes the results in an RRD-file. The statistics gathered
[T] include: CPU and memory usage, network interface traffic, and system
[T] temperatures (using lm-sensors). In network mode, clients multicast
[T] their values over the network to servers which write the RRD-files.
