[I] A utility for monitoring Unix system services

[T] Monit is a utility for managing and monitoring processes, files,
[T] directories, and devices on a Unix system. It conducts automatic
[T] maintenance and repair and can execute meaningful causal actions in error
[T] situations. It can be used to monitor files, directories, and devices
[T] for changes, such as timestamps changes, checksum changes, or size
[T] changes. It is controlled via an easy to configure control file based
[T] on a free-format, token-oriented syntax. It logs to syslog or to its
[T] own log file and notifies users about error conditions via customizable
[T] alert messages. It can perform various TCP/IP network checks, protocol
[T] checks, and can utilize SSL for such checks. It provides an HTTP(S)
[T] interface for access.
