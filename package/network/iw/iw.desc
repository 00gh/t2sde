[I] New configuration tools for Linux wireless networking

[T] iw is a new nl80211 based CLI configuration utility for wireless devices.
[T] It supports all new drivers that have been added to the kernel recently.
[T] The old tool iwconfing, which uses Wireless Extensions interface, is
[T] deprecated and it's strongly recommended to switch to iw and nl80211.
