[I] Software for PXE, auto-kickstart, and virtualization provisioning

[T] Cobbler is a command line tool for configuring provisioning
[T] and update servers. It supports provisioning via PXE,
[T] virtualization (Xen), and re-provisioning an existing Linux system
[T] (&amp;quot;auto-kickstarting&amp;quot;) when having a PXE environment
[T] isn't possible. The latter two features are enabled by usage of ÆkoanÆ
[T] (a client side provisioning application) on the remote system. Update
[T] server features include yum mirroring over rsync:// and integration
[T] of those mirrors with kickstart. Cobbler is easy to use and has an
[T] accompanying Python API. It supports RHEL4+, Fedora Core 5+, and
[T] derivative distributions.
