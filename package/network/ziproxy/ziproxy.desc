[I] A gzipping, Image compressing, forwarding HTTP Proxy

[T] Ziproxy is a forwarding (non-caching) proxy that gzips text and HTML
[T] files, and reduces the size of images by converting them to lower
[T] quality JPEGs. It is intended to increase the speed for low-speed
[T] Internet connections and it's suitable for both home and professional
[T] usage. Ziproxy is fully configurable and also features transparent proxy
[T] mode, preemptive name resolution, operation in either daemon mode or
[T] (x)inetd mode, a detailed access log with compression statistics, basic
[T] authentication, and more.
