[I] A network traffic probe that shows the network usage

[T] Ntop is a network traffic probe that shows the network usage, similar to
[T] what the popular top Unix command does. Ntop is based on libpcap and it
[T] has been written in a portable way in order to virtually run on every
[T] Unix platform and on Win32 as well.
[T]
[T] Ntop users can use a a web browser (e.g. netscape) to navigate through
[T] ntop (that acts as a web server) traffic information and get a dump of
[T] the network status. In the latter case, ntop can be seen as a simple
[T] RMON-like agent with an embedded web interface.
