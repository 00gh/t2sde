[I] A simpler replacement for X

[T] Wayland is intended as a simpler replacement for X.

[T] Wayland is a protocol for a compositor to talk to its clients as well
[T] as a C library implementation of that protocol. The compositor can be a
[T] standalone display server running on Linux kernel modesetting and evdev
[T] input devices, an X application, or a wayland client itself. The clients
[T] can be traditional applications, X servers or other display servers.
