[I] A compact multilingual text to speech synthesis engine

[T] ESpeak is a compact text to speech engine for good quality English and
[T] other languages. Its clear articulation and good intonation makes it
[T] suitable for listening to long text articles. It can speak text files
[T] from the command line, and also operates as a &amp;quot;talker&amp;quot;
[T] within the KDE TTS system as an alternative to Festival etc.
