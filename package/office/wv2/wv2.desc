[I] Microsoft Word file access library

[T] wv is a library which allows access to Microsoft Word files. It can
[T] load and parse Word 2000, 97, 95 and 6 file formats. (These are the
[T] file formats known internally as Word 9, 8, 7 and 6.) There is some
[T] support for reading earlier formats as well: Word 2 docs are converted
[T] to plaintext.
