[I] A parser and API for OFX command responses

[T] LibOFX is a parser and an API designed to allow applications to
[T] very easily support OFX command responses, usually provided
[T] by financial institutions for statement downloads. To my
[T] knowledge, it is the first working OpenSource implementation
[T] of the OFX (Open Financial eXchange) specification on the
[T] client side.
