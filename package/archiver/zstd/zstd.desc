[I] Fast real-time compression algorithm

[T] Zstandard is a real-time compression algorithm, providing high compression
[T] ratios. It offers a very wide range of compression / speed trade-off,
[T] while being backed by a very fast decoder (see benchmarks below). It also
[T] offers a special mode for small data, called dictionary compression, and
[T] can create dictionaries from any sample set.
