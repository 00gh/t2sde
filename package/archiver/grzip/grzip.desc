[I] A high-performance and fast general purpose file compressor

[T] Grzip is a high-performance file compressor based on Burrows-Wheeler
[T] Transform, Schindler Transform, Move-To-Front, and Weighted Frequency
[T] Counting. It uses the Block-Sorting Lossless Data Compression Algorithm,
[T] which has received considerable attention in recent years for both its
[T] simplicity and effectiveness. This implementation has a compression rate
[T] of 2. 234 bps on the Calgary Corpus (14 files) without preprocessing
[T] filters. This is essentially an adaptation/extension of GRZipII by
[T] Ilya Grebnov.
