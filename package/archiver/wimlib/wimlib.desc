[I] The open source Windows Imaging (WIM) library

[T] Wimlib is an open source, cross-platform library for creating, extracting,
[T] and modifying Windows Imaging (WIM) archives. WIM is a file archiving
[T] format, somewhat comparable to ZIP (and many other file archiving formats);
[T] but unlike ZIP, it allows storing various Windows-specific metadata, allows
[T] storing multiple "images" in a single archive, automatically deduplicates
[T] all file contents, and supports optional solid compression to get a better
[T] compression ratio. wimlib and its command-line frontend wimlib-imagex
[T] provide a free and cross-platform alternative to Microsoft's WIMGAPI,
[T] ImageX, and DISM.
