[I] Python module for downloading files

[T] urlgrabber is a pure python package that drastically simplifies the
[T] fetching of files. It is designed to be used in programs that need common
[T] (but not necessarily simple) url-fetching features. It is extremely simple
[T] to drop into an existing program and provides a clean interface to
[T] protocol-independant file-access.
