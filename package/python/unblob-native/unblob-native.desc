[I] Performance-critical functionality for Unblob

[T] This package holds performance-critical components of Unblob, an accurate,
[T] fast, and easy-to-use extraction suite. It parses unknown binary blobs for
[T] more than 30 different archive, compression, and file-system formats,
[T] extracts their content recursively, and carves out unknown chunks that have
[T] not been accounted for.
