[I] World timezone definitions, modern and historical

[T] pytz brings the Olson tz database into Python. This library allows accurate
[T] and cross platform timezone calculations using Python 2.4 or higher. It
[T] also solves the issue of ambiguous times at the end of daylight saving
[T] time, which you can read more about in the Python Library Reference
[T] (datetime.tzinfo).
