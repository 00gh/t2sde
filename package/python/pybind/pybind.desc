[I] Seamless operability between C++11 and Python

[T] Pybind11 is a lightweight header-only library that exposes C++ types in
[T] Python and vice versa, mainly to create Python bindings of existing C++
[T] code. Its goals and syntax are similar to the excellent Boost.Python
[T] library by David Abrahams: to minimize boilerplate code in
[T] traditional extension modules by inferring type information
[T] using compile-time introspection.
