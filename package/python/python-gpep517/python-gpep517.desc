[I] Minimal backend script to aid installing Python packages through PEP 517-compliant build systems

[T] gpep517 is a minimal tool to aid building wheels for Python packages
[T] through PEP 517-compliant build systems and installing them. The tool
[T] originated from Gentoo with its primary goals being absolutely minimal
[T] dependency footprint to ease clean bootstrap without bundling
[T] dependencies, and clean separation of functions to aid external
[T] package managers. It is the tool of choice for a world that does not
[T] revolve around pip and venvs.
