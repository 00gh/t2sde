[I] A minimal low-level HTTP client

[T] The HTTP Core package provides a minimal low-level HTTP client, which does
[T] one thing only. Sending HTTP requests.It does not provide any high level
[T] model abstractions over the API, does not handle redirects, multipart
[T] uploads, building authentication headers, transparent HTTP caching, URL
[T] parsing, session cookie handling, content or charset decoding, handling
[T] JSON, environment based configuration defaults, or any of that Jazz.
