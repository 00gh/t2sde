[I] Reusable constraint types to use with typing.Annotated

[T] This package provides metadata objects which can be used to represent
[T] common constraints such as upper and lower bounds on scalar values and
[T] collection sizes, a Predicate marker for runtime checks, and descriptions
[T] of how we intend these metadata to be interpreted. In some cases, we also
[T] note alternative representations which do not require this package.
