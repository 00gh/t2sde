[I] Backported and Experimental Type Hints for Python 3.8+

[T] The typing_extensions module serves two related purposes: 1. Enable use of
[T] new type system features on older Python versions. For example,
[T] typing.TypeGuard is new in Python 3.10, but typing_extensions allows users
[T] on previous Python versions to use it too. 2. Enable experimentation with
[T] new type system PEPs before they are accepted and added to the typing
[T] module.
