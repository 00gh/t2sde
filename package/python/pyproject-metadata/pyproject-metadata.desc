[I] Generate PEP 643 compliant metadata files from PEP 621 metadata

[T] This project does not implement the parsing of pyproject.toml containing
[T] PEP 621 metadata. Instead, given a Python data structure representing PEP
[T] 621 metadata (already parsed), it will validate this input and generate a
[T] PEP 643-compliant metadata file (e.g. PKG-INFO).
