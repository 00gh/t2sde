[I] Compatibility layer for multiple asynchronous event loop implementations

[T] AnyIO is an asynchronous networking and concurrency library that works on
[T] top of either asyncio or trio. It implements trio-like structured
[T] concurrency (SC) on top of asyncio and works in harmony with the native SC
[T] of trio itself.
