[I] Sniff out which async library your code is running under

[T] You're writing a library. You've decided to be ambitious, and support
[T] multiple async I/O packages, like Trio, and asyncio, and you've written a
[T] bunch of clever code to handle all the differences. But how do you know
[T] which piece of clever code to run? This is a tiny package whose only
[T] purpose is to let you detect which async library your code is running under.
