[I] A pure-Python, bring-your-own-I/O implementation of HTTP/1.1

[T] It's a "bring-your-own-I/O" library; h11 contains no IO code whatsoever.
[T] This means you can hook h11 up to your favorite network API, and that could
[T] be anything you want: synchronous, threaded, asynchronous, or your own
[T] implementation of RFC 6214 -- h11 won't judge you. (Compare this to the
[T] current state of the art, where every time a new network API comes along
[T] then someone gets to start over reimplementing the entire HTTP protocol
[T] from scratch.)
