[I] An IMMENSELY FAST JPEG thumbnailer library

[T] It makes use of libjpeg features of being able to load an image by only
[T] decoding the DCT coefficients needed to reconstruct an image of the size
[T] desired. This gives a massive speedup. If you do not try and access the
[T] pixels in a format other than YUV (or GRAY8 if the source is grascale)
[T] then it also avoids colorspace conversions as well.
