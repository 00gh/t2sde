[I] A miniature "ZIP FILE" like library

[T] Eet is a small and very useful library that does 2 things. It acts as a
[T] miniature "ZIP FILE" library. It doesn't handle ZIP format files as the
[T] ZIP format is more complex than is needed, but it does a similar thing
[T] where it can store multiple "files" within 1 compressed archive file AND
[T] randomly access every "file" within the archive very quickly, and
[T] decompress for you.
