[I] A library and Etk interface builder

[T] Evolve is a library that allows you to specify an Etk application's interface
[T] using an Edje (C style) like language. The sources (.etk files) can be compiled
[T] (into .eet files) and can then be hooked up to your applications logic.
[T] Evolve also contains a gui, Evolve Builder that allows you to build Evolve
[T] files using a graphical user interface (work in progress).
