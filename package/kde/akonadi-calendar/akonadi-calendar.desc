[I] Akonadi calendar integration

[T] Akonadi Calendar is a library that effectively bridges the type-agnostic 
[T] API of the Akonadi client libraries and the domain-specific KCalCore 
[T] library. It provides jobs, models and other helpers to make working with 
[T] events and calendars through Akonadi easier.
