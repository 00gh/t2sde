[I] A wrapper library for evdev devices

[T] libevdev is a wrapper library for evdev devices. it moves the common
[T] tasks when dealing with evdev devices into a library and provides a
[T] library interface to the callers, thus avoiding erroneous ioctls, etc.
[T]
[T] The eventual goal is that libevdev wraps all ioctls available to evdev
[T] devices, thus making direct access unnecessary.
