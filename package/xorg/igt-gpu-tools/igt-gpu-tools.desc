[I] Collection of tools for development and testing of the DRM drivers

[T] IGT GPU Tools is a collection of tools for development and testing of the
[T] DRM drivers. There are many macro-level test suites that get used against
[T] the drivers, including xtest, rendercheck, piglit, and oglconform, but
[T] failures from those can be difficult to track down to kernel changes,
[T] and many require complicated build procedures or specific testing
[T] environments to get useful results. Therefore, IGT GPU Tools includes
[T] low-level tools and tests specifically for development and testing of
[T] the DRM Drivers.
