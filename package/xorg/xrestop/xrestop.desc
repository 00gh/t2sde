[I] Top like statistics of each connected X11 client's resource usage

[T] Xrestop uses the X-Resource extension to provide 'top' like statistics of
[T] each connected X11 client's server side resource usage. It is intended as
[T] a developer tool to aid more efficient server resource usage and debug
[T] server side leakage.
[T] It should work with any server supporting the X-Resource extension,
[T] including the Xorg server and XFree86 4.3+.
