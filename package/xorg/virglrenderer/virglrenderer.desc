[I] A research project to creating a virtual 3D GPU

[T] Virgil is a research project to investigate the possibility of creating a
[T] virtual 3D GPU for use inside qemu virtual machines, that allows the guest
[T] operating system to use the capabilities of the host GPU to accelerate 3D
[T] rendering. The plan is to have a guest GPU that is fully independent of
[T] the host GPU.
