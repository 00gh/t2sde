[I] A compatibility layer for running Windows applications

[T] Wine (originally an acronym for "Wine Is Not an Emulator") is a
[T] compatibility layer capable of running Windows applications on several
[T] POSIX-compliant operating systems, such as Linux, macOS, & BSD. Instead
[T] of simulating internal Windows logic like a virtual machine or emulator,
[T] Wine translates Windows API calls into POSIX calls on-the-fly, eliminating
[T] the performance and memory penalties of other methods and allowing you to
[T] cleanly integrate Windows applications into your desktop.
