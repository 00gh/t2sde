[I] Intel(R) Open Path Guiding Library

[T] The Intel Open Path Guiding Library (Intel Open PGL) implements a set of
[T] representations and training algorithms needed to integrate path guiding
[T] into a renderer. Open PGL offers implementations of current state-of-the-art
[T] path guiding methods, which increase the sampling quality and, therefore,
[T] the efficiency of a renderer. The goal of Open PGL is to provide
[T] implementations that are well tested and robust enough to be used in a
[T] production environment.
