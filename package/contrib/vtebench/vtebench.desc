[I] Terminal benchmarks

[T] Generate benchmarks for terminal emulators. This benchmark is not
[T] sufficient to get a general understanding of the performance of a terminal
[T] emulator. It lacks support for critical factors like frame rate or latency.
[T] The only factor this benchmark stresses is the speed at which a terminal
[T] reads from the PTY.
