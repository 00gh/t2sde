[I] A Console Spy Tool

[T] Conspy allows a (possibly remote) user to see what is displayed on a
[T] Linux virtual console, and to send keystrokes to it. It only known
[T] to work with Linux. It is rather like VNC, but where VNC takes control
[T] of a GUI, conspy takes control of a text-mode virtual console.
[T] Unlike VNC, conspy does not require a server to be installed prior to
[T] being used.
