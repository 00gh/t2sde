[I] Command-line utility for vkBasalt

[T] vkbasalt-cli (filename vkbasalt) is a CLI utility and library in
[T] conjunction with vkBasalt. This makes generating configuration
[T] files or running vkBasalt with games easier. This is mainly
[T] convenient in environments where integrating vkBasalt is
[T] wishful, for example a GUI application. Integrating
[T] vkbasalt-cli allows a front-end to easily generate and use specific
[T] configurations on the fly, without asking the user to manually
[T] write a configuration file.
