[I] A general dimension code for computing convex hulls and related structures

[T] Qhull is a general dimension convex hull program that reads a set
[T] of points from stdin, and outputs the smallest convex set that contains
[T] the points to stdout. It also generates Delaunay triangulations, Voronoi
[T] diagrams, furthest-site Voronoi diagrams, and halfspace intersections
[T] about a point.
