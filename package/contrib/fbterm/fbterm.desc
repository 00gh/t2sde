[I] A fast frame buffer-based terminal emulator for Linux

[T] FbTerm is a fast terminal emulator for Linux that uses the frame
[T] buffer. It is mostly as fast as the Linux kernel's terminal when
[T] accelerated scrolling is enabled on the frame buffer device. It allows you
[T] to select fonts with fontconfig, auto-detect and convert text encoding
[T] with support for double width scripts like Chinese and Japanese etc,
[T] dynamically create and destroy up to 10 windows, record scroll-back
[T] history for every window, and copy/paste selected text between windows
[T] with mouse the when the gpm server is running.
