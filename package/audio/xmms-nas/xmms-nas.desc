[I] XMMS output plugin to use NAS

[T] The Network Audio System is used on most NCD X-terminals and is sometimes
[T] part of the standard X distribution, primarily for getting the sound to
[T] the right place.
[T]
[T] Be aware that you're sending upto 180 kb/sec over the network between your
[T] X-terminal and the machine you're running xmms on. Don't blame me if some
[T] sysadmin kicks your butt for hogging the network.
[T]
[T] The Network Audio System doesn't support separate left and right volume,
[T] so the balance slider will not work.
