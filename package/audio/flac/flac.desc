[I] An Free Lossless Audio Codec

[T] Grossly oversimplified, FLAC is similar to MP3, but lossless, meaning
[T] that audio is compressed in FLAC without throwing away any information.
[T] This is similar to how Zip works, except with FLAC you will get much
[T] better compression because it is designed specifically for audio,
[T]
[T] FLAC consists of:
[T] - `libFLAC', a library which implements reference encoders and
[T] decoders, and a metadata interface
[T] - `libFLAC++', a C++ object wrapper library around libFLAC
[T] - `libOggFLAC' and `libOggFLAC++', which provide encoders and
[T] decoders for FLAC streams in an Ogg container
[T] - `flac', a command-line program for encoding and decoding files
[T] - `metaflac', a command-line program for editing FLAC metadata
[T] - player plugins for XMMS and Winamp
[T] - user and API documentation
