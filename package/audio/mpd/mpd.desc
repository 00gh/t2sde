[I] A jukebox server that controls music playback (MP3, Ogg and Flac)

[T] Music Player Daemon (MPD) is a server that allows remote access for
[T] playing music (MP3, Ogg Vorbis and Flac) and managing playlists.
[T] The design focus is on integrating a computer into a stereo system
[T] that provides control for music playback over a local network.
[T] Currently, it includes a Web interface, phpMp, a GTK frontend,
[T] gtk2mp, a command line tool, mpc, and a dock app, WMmp. The goals are
[T] to be easy to install and use, to have minimal resource requirements,
[T] and to be stable and flexible.
