[I] Advanced Linux Sound Architecture OSS emulation library

[T] ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) is the next generation
[T] Linux Sound API.
[T] It provides much finer (->better) access to the sound hardware,
[T] has a unbeatable mixer API and supports stuff like multi channel
[T] hardware, digital outs and ins, uninterleaved sound data access,
[T] ..., ... and an oss emulation layer (for the old applications).
[T] It is the prefered API for professional sound apps under Linux.
