[I] A library for reading raw photo images

[T] LibRaw is a library for reading RAW files obtained from digital photo
[T] cameras (CRW/CR2, NEF, RAF, DNG, and others). LibRaw is based on the
[T] source codes of the dcraw utility, though some of the drawbacks of dcraw
[T] have been eliminated. The users of the library are provided with an API
[T] to be used when writing their software programs.
