[I] An HPGL distiller for vinyl cutters

[T] HPGL-Distiller filters out aspects of an HPGL file which are not relevant
[T] for various HPGL output devices, typically vinyl cutters. Irrelevant codes
[T] are filtered out to prevent many vinyl cutters from responding poorly to
[T] the excess data. With the use of HPGL-Distiller, you can use Inkscape,
[T] QCAD, GIMP, and many others to produce appropriate vinyl cutting output
[T] results.
