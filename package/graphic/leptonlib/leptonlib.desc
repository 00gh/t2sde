[I] C library for some basic image processing operations

[T] C library for some basic image processing operations, along with a
[T] description of the functions and some design methods. A full set of
[T] affine transformations (translation, shear, rotation, scaling) on
[T] images of all depths is included, with the exception that some of
[T] the scaling methods do not work at all depths.
