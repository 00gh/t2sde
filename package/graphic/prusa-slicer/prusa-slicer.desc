[I] G-code generator for 3D printers

[T] PrusaSlicer is based on Slic3r by Alessandro Ranellucci and the RepRap community.
[T] It takes 3D models (STL, OBJ, AMF) and converts them into G-code instructions for
[T] FFF printers or PNG layers for mSLA 3D printers. It's compatible with any modern
[T] printer based on the RepRap toolchain, including all those based on the Marlin,
[T] Prusa, Sprinter and Repetier firmware. It also works with Mach3, LinuxCNC and
[T] Machinekit controllers.
