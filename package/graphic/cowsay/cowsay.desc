[I] A program to make speaking and thinking cow quotes

[T] Cowsay is the easy way to add speaking and thinking cows (and a few other
[T] creatures) to anything. Any message you like, even in large figlet letters,
[T] can be rattled off by these ASCII critters. Cowsay comes with over 40
[T] creatures that can be bent to your sick and twisted will. New "cows" can be
[T] easily bred by those versed in the appropriate dark arts.
