[I] A set of tools for photometric calibration of HDR and LDR cameras

[T] PFSCalibration provides an implementation of the Robertson et al. 2003
[T] method for the photometric calibration of cameras and for the recovery of
[T] high dynamic range (HDR) images from teh set of low dynamic range (LDR)
[T] exposures. The tools included can be used for photometric calibration of
[T] both off-the-shelf digital cameras and HDR cameras as described in the MPI
