[I] A program for making large letters out of ordinary text

[T] FIGlet prints its input using large characters (called
[T] ``FIGcharacters'')made up of ordinary screen characters
[T] (called ``sub-characters''). FIGlet output is generally
[T] reminiscent of the sort of ``signatures'' many people like
[T] to put at the end of e-mail and UseNet messages. It is
[T] also reminiscent of the output of some banner programs,
[T] although it is oriented normally, not sideways.
