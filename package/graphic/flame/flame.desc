[I] Flame is an cosmic recursive fractal flames generator

[T] Fractal Flames are algorithmically generated images and animations. You can
[T] create your own flames with the gimp's flame plugin, included in the gimp
[T] distribution, and use Flame to convert the gimp generated files, animate
[T] them, morph them, and render them in the command line. You can also use the
[T] ElectricSheep distributed screen saver, to join the collective evolution of
[T] animated fractal flames.
