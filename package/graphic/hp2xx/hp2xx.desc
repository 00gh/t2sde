[I] HP-GL converter and viewer

[T] Hp2xx is a versatile tool to convert vector-oriented graphics data
[T] given in Hewlett-Packard's HP-GL (HPGL) plotter language into a
[T] variety of popular both vector- and raster-oriented graphics
[T] formats. The various supported output formats include Encapsulated
[T] PostScript (EPS), PCX, IMG, and several formats intended to
[T] facilitate the generation of graphics within TeX documents. In
[T] addition, hp2xx output is printable on the HP Laserjet/Deskjet
[T] printer series, and it may be used as a HP-GL previewer on many
[T] platforms, e.g. X11 and DOS (VGA).
