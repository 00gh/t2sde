[I] JPEG to PostScript Level 2 (or PostScript 3) wrapper

[T] Jpeg2ps is a utility for converting JPEG images to compressed PostScript
[T] Level 2 or 3 files (without uncompressing the images). The JPEG data is
[T] simply "wrapped" with PostScript which yields considerably smaller PS
[T] files. Jpeg2ps is a simple command line utility and can be used on Unix,
[T] as well as DOS and Windows machines
