[I] A tool to enhance scanned book page images

[T] Unpaper is a post-processing tool for scanned sheets of paper,
[T] especially for book pages that have been scanned from previously created
[T] photocopies. It can make scanned pages more readable on a screen and
[T] more acceptable for OCR. unpaper removes dark edges from the image and
[T] also tries to unskew or rotate pages to make the text horizontal.
