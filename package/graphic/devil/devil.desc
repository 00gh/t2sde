[I] Open Source image loading, saving and manipulation library

[T] DevIL (formerly OpenIL) offers very powerful image loading capabilities,
[T] yet is easy for a developer to learn and use. Ultimate control of images
[T] is left to the developer, so unnecessary conversions, etc. are not
[T] performed. DevIL utilizes a simple, yet powerful, syntax. DevIL can load,
[T] save, convert, manipulate, filter and display a wide variety of image
[T] formats.
