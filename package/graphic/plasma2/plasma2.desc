[I] An advanced plasma fractal pattern generation GIMP plugin

[T] Plasma2 is a heavily improved version, of an old Gimp plugin, Plasma, by
[T] Stephen Norris. This plugin generates cloud-like structures, known as
[T] "plasma fractals". Brief list of fixes and improvements against the original
[T] Plasma. Several new generator options, including the possibility to generate
[T] original Fracting-like and Norris-like plasmas. It can now generate tileable
[T] images, in a much more efficient than the original Plasma's Make_Seamless.
[T] Can directly map to a gradient, and do gradient remixes, and general speed
[T] improvements.
