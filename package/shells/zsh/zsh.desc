[I] Z-Shell

[T] Zsh is a UNIX command interpreter (shell) which of the standard shells most
[T] resembles the Korn shell (ksh). It includes enhancements of many types,
[T] notably in the command-line editor, options for customising its behaviour,
[T] filename globbing, features to make C-shell (csh) users feel more at home
[T] and extra features drawn from tcsh.
