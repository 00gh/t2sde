[I] A new type of shell

[T] The goal of this project is to take the Unix philosophy of shells, where
[T] pipes connect simple commands together, and bring it to the modern style of
[T] development. Thus, rather than being either a shell, or a programming
[T] language, Nushell connects both by bringing a rich programming language and
[T] a full-featured shell together into one package.
