[I] The GNU Bourne Again shell

[T] Bash is a Unix command interpreter (shell). It is an implementation of
[T] the Posix 1004.0 shell standard, and resembles the Korn and System V
[T] shells.
[T]
[T] Bash contains a number of enhancements over those shells, both
[T] for interactive use and shell programming. Features geared toward
[T] interactive use include command line editing, command history, job
[T] control, aliases, and prompt expansion. Programming features include
[T] additional variable expansions, shell arithmetic, and a number of
[T] variables and options to control shell behavior.
