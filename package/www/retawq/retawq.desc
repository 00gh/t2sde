[I] A multi-threaded Web browser for text terminals

[T] Retawq is a multi-threaded Web browser for text terminals on computers
[T] with Unix-like operating systems. It is fast, small, nicely configurable,
[T] and comfortable; e. G. The low-level network communications are performed
[T] in a non-blocking way, and you can keep open as many &amp;quot;virtual
[T] windows&amp;quot; as you want and work simultaneously in two of them in
[T] a split-screen mode.
