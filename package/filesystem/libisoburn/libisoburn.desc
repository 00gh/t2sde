[I] A library and an application for multi-session ISO 9660 filesystems

[T] Libisoburn coordinates libburn and libisofs to enable creation and
[T] manipulation of ISO-9660 filesystems on CD, DVD, BD, in disk files,
[T] or into pipes. It comes with a command line application named xorriso,
[T] which goes quite beyond the limitations of mkisofs.
