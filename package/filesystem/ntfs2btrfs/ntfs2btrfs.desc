[I] A tool for in-place conversion of Microsoft's NTFS to Btrfs

[T] Ntfs2btrfs is a tool which does in-place conversion of Microsoft's NTFS
[T] filesystem to the open-source filesystem Btrfs, much as btrfs-convert does
[T] for ext2. The original image is saved as a reflink copy at image/ntfs.img,
[T] and if you want to keep the conversion you can delete this to free up space.
