[I] A Simple Authentication and Security Layer library

[T] GNU SASL is an implementation of the Simple Authentication and Security
[T] Layer framework and a few common SASL mechanisms. SASL is used by network
[T] servers such as IMAP and SMTP to request authentication from clients, and
[T] in clients to authenticate against servers. The library includes support
[T] for the SASL framework (with authentication functions and application
[T] data privacy and integrity functions) and at least partial support for
[T] the CRAM-MD5, EXTERNAL, GSSAPI, ANONYMOUS, PLAIN, SECURID, DIGEST-MD5,
[T] LOGIN, NTLM, and KERBEROS_V5 mechanisms.
