[I] A framework for layer 2 attacks

[T] Yersinia implements several attacks for the following protocols:
[T] Spanning Tree (STP), Cisco Discovery (CDP), Dynamic Host
[T] Configuration (DHCP), Hot Standby Router (HSRP), Dynamic Trunking
[T] (DTP), 802.1q, Inter-Switch Link Protocol (ISL), and VLAN Trunking
[T] (VTP). It helps the pen-tester in different tasks, such as becoming
[T] the root role in the Spanning Tree, creating virtual CDP neighbors,
[T] setting up rogue DHCP servers, becoming the active router in a HSRP
[T] scenario, enabling trunk, performing ARP spoofing over VLAN hopping,
[T] adding or deleting VLANs (via VTP), and more.
