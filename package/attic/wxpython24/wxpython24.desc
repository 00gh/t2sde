[I] WxWindows bindings for Python

[T] WxPython is a GUI toolkit for the Python programming language. It allows
[T] Python programmers to create programs with a robust, highly functional
[T] graphical user interface, simply and easily. It is implemented as a Python
[T] extension module (native code) that wraps the popular wxWidgets cross
[T] platform GUI library, which is written in C++.
