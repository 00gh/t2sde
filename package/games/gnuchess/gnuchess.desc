[I] GNU chess

[T] GNU Chess lets most modern computers play a full game of chess. It
[T] has a plain terminal interface but supports visual interfaces such
[T] as X-Windows "xboard".
[T]
[T] Version 5.06 is the current release. Version 5 shares no code with
[T] versions 1.x through 4.x. This release features simplified chess code
[T] and modern data structures, which make it more pedantically accessible,
[T] easier to modify, and more understandable for skilled chess experts
[T] who are not necessarily programmers.
[T]
[T] Chua Kong-Sian is the primary author of GNU Chess 5's precursor
[T] program (Cobalt, which maintains a separate but cooperative parallel
[T] development path.) Several features have been integrated or written
[T] by Stuart Cracraft (opening book code, documentation, ability to play
[T] on Free Internet Chess Server etc.)
