[I] An arcade game similar to Marble Madness

[T] Trackballs is a simple game similar to the classic game Marble Madness. By
[T] steering a marble through a track filled with vicious hammers, pools
[T] of acid, and other obstacles the player collects points. When the ball
[T] reaches the destination, the player continue to the next, more difficult
[T] track - unless, of course, time runs out first.
