[I] XBlast TNT

[T] XBlast is a multi-player arcade game for X11R5/R6 (v2.6 or TNT) and
[T] Windows (TNT version only). The game can be played with at least two
[T] players and up to six players. It was inspired by the video/computer
[T] game Bomberman (Dynablaster), which was to my knowledge first
[T] programmed for NEC's PC Engine/Turbo Grafx. Other commercial versions
[T] of the original game exist for IBM-PC, Atari ST, Amiga [trop cool
[T] l'Amiga], NES, GameBoy and Super NES.
