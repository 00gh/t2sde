[I] A graphical single player sci-fi RPG featuring Tux and evil MS bots

[T] A graphical single player sci-fi RPG featuring Tux and evil MS bots
[T]
[T] This game evolved as an extension of the arcade game Freedriod into an
[T] RPG.
[T]
[T] The MS has taken over the galaxy via their trojan horse OS that was
[T] running everywhere. But twenty years after the MS took over, the Bots
[T] rebelled and attacked all life forms. Humans and Linarians (like the
[T] Tux) had to flee to some remote planets and now live underground,
[T] struggling to survive. This is when suddenly, after thousands of years,
[T] the Tux is released from some stasis field on one of the small colonies
[T] in the outskirts of the Galaxy. There is one older city, that has been
[T] there even before the Great Assault (of the Bots against everyone) and
[T] there are also new settlements founded by some who arrived later, but of
[T] those we have not much done yet.
[T]
[T] The weapon and character system was modeled after Diablo I, while some
[T] elements of Freedroid like the takeover game have been introduced as
[T] extra 'hacking' skill.
[T]
[T] Formerly the announcements for this game (0.9.0-preview) came with
[T] 'Freedroid classic' but the games have now developed so differently,
[T] that we considered it justified to announce this as a separate game.
[T] Comments to Freedroid RPG please here. The Freedroid classic will reach
[T] the final version 1.0 in may of this year while the 'Freedroid RPG' game
[T] will continue development.
[T]
[T] Ideas and submissions for new characters, dialogs, missions, voices and
[T] portraits and the like very much appreciated.
