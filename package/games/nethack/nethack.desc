[I] A single player dungeon exploration game

[T] NetHack is a single player dungeon exploration game that runs on a wide
[T] variety of computer systems, with a variety of graphical and text
[T] interfaces all using the same game engine. Unlike many other Dungeons &
[T] Dragons-inspired games, the emphasis in NetHack is on discovering the
[T] detail of the dungeon and not simply killing everything in sight - in
[T] fact, killing everything in sight is a good way to die quickly. Each
[T] game presents a different landscape - the random number generator
[T] provides an essentially unlimited number of variations of the dungeon
[T] and its denizens to be discovered by the player in one of a number of
[T] characters: you can pick your race, your role, and your gender.
