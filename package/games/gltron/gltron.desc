[I] An OpenGL clone of Tron

[T] GLTron is inspired by the movie TRON. Or more exactly, by all the games
[T] that where inspired by the movie TRON.
[T]
[T] You steer a futuristic bike, called lightcycle. Combat takes place in a
[T] rectangular arena. Your bike leaves a trail behind, which is like a
[T] wall. The goal is to force the other players to drive into a wall.
[T] The winner is the last player alive.
[T]
[T] NOTE: this package _needs_ a supported 3d video accelerator.
