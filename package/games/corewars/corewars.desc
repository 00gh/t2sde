[I] Let progams fight each other in memory

[T] Corewars is a simulation game where a number of warriors try to
[T] crash each other while they are running in a virtual computer.
[T] The warriors can be written in one of two assembler-like languages
[T] called Corewars and Redcode. Corewars is the default language and
[T] is easier to learn and understand. Redcode provides more advanced
[T] and powerful instructions but also requires more time to learn.
