[I] Easily build XS extensions that depend on XS extensions

[T] This module tries to make it easy to build Perl extensions that use
[T] functions and typemaps provided by other perl extensions. This means
[T] that a perl extension is treated like a shared library that provides
[T] also a C and an XS interface besides the perl one.
