[I] Perl Layout and render international text

[T] Pango is a library for laying out and rendering text, with an emphasis on
[T] internationalization. Pango can be used anywhere that text layout is
[T] needed, but using Pango in conjunction with Cairo and/or Gtk2 provides a
[T] complete solution with high quality text handling and graphics rendering.
