[I] Perl module for manipulating IPv4 addresses

[T] Net::IPv4Addr provides functions for parsing IPv4 addresses both in traditional
[T] address/netmask format and in the new CIDR format. There are also methods for
[T] calculating the network and broadcast address and also to see check if a given
[T] address is in a specific network.
