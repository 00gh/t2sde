[I] A super-simplistic front-end to pkg-config for Makefile.PLs

[T] The pkg-config program retrieves information about installed libraries,
[T] usually for the purposes of compiling against and linking to them.
[T] ExtUtils::PkgConfig is a very simplistic interface to this utility,
[T] intended for use in the Makefile.PL of perl extensions which bind
[T] libraries that pkg-config knows. It is really just boilerplate code that
[T] you would've written yourself.
