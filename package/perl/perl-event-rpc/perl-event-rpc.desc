[I] Event based transparent Client/Server RPC framework

[T] Event::RPC supports you in developing Event based networking
[T] client/server applications with transparent object/method access from
[T] the client to the server. Network communication is optionally encrypted
[T] using IO::Socket::SSL. Several event loop managers are supported due to
[T] an extensible API. Currently Event and Glib are implemented.
