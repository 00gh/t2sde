[I] A Just-In-Time Compiler for the Lua programming language

[T] LuaJIT is based on the Lua 5.1.x virtual machine and bytecode interpreter
[T] from lua.org. It compiles bytecode to native x86 (i386+) machine code to
[T] speed up the execution of Lua programs.
[T]
[T] An innovative trace compiler is integrated with advanced, SSA-based
[T] optimizations and a highly tuned code generation backend. This allows a
[T] substantial reduction of the overhead associated with dynamic language
[T] features. It's destined to break into the performance range traditionally
[T] reserved for offline, static language compilers.
