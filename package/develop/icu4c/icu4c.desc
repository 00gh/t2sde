[I] International Components for Unicode for C/C++

[T] The C and C++ languages and many operating system environments do
[T] not provide full support for Unicode and standards-compliant text
[T] handling services. Even though some platforms do provide good Unicode
[T] text handling services, portable application code can not make use
[T] of them. The ICU4C libraries fills in this gap. ICU4C provides an
[T] open, flexible, portable foundation for applications to use for
[T] their software globalization requirements. ICU4C closely tracks
[T] industry standards, including Unicode and CLDR (Common Locale Data
[T] Repository).
