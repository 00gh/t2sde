[I] Clang

[T] Low-Level Virtual Machine (LLVM) is a compiler infrastructure designed for
[T] compile-time, link-time, run-time, and "idle-time" optimization of
[T] programs from arbitrary programming languages. It currently supports
[T] compilation of C, Objective-C, and C++ programs, using front-ends derived
[T] from GCC 4.0, GCC 4.2, and a custom new front-end, "clang". It supports
[T] x86, x86-64, ia64, PowerPC, and SPARC, with support for Alpha and ARM
[T] under development.
