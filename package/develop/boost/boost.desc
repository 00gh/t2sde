[I] Peer-reviewed STL style libraries for C++

[T] Boost provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries. The
[T] emphasis is on libraries which work well with the C++ Standard Library.
[T] One goal is to establish "existing practice" and provide reference
[T] implementations so that the Boost libraries are suitable for eventual
[T] standardization. Some of the libraries have already been proposed for
[T] inclusion in the C++ Standards Committee's upcoming C++ Standard Library
[T] Technical Report.
