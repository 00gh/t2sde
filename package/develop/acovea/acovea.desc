[I] A genetic algorithm that finds the best compilation options

[T] Acovea implements a genetic algorithm for finding the best options for
[T] compiling programs with the GCC C and C++ compilers. Best, in this
[T] context, is defined as those options that produce the fastest executable
[T] program from a given source code. The framework can be extended to other
[T] programming languages and non-GCC compilers. It is also useful for testing
[T] combinations of flags for pessimistic interactions, and for testing the
[T] reliability of the compiler.
