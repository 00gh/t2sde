[I] A library for working with Windows Registry "hive" binary files

[T] This is a self-contained library for reading and writing Windows
[T] Registry "hive" binary files.
[T]
[T] Unlike many other tools in this area, it doesn't use the textual .REG
[T] format for output, because parsing that is as much trouble as parsing
[T] the original binary format. Instead it makes the file available
[T] through a C API, or there is a separate program to export the hive as
[T] XML.
