[I] Modern Low-Level 3D Graphics Library and Rendering Framework

[T] A lightweight graphics API abstraction library and rendering framework.
[T] It is designed to take full advantage of Vulkan, Metal and WebGPU,
[T] while supporting older platforms via OpenGL, OpenGLES and WebGL.
[T] Diligent Engine exposes common front-end API and uses HLSL as universal 
[T] shading language on all platforms and rendering back-ends.
[T] The engine is intended to be used as graphics subsystem in a game engine
[T] or any other 3D application.
