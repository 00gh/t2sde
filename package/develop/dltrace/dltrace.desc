[I] Dynamic library call tracer

[T] dltrace is a dynamic library call tracer which attempts to remain portable
[T] to all x86 platforms that support ELF binaries and expose a debugging
[T] interface via procfs or the ptrace() system call. The shared library call
[T] tracing is done at a level which allows calls to all symbols exported by
[T] loaded libraries to be traced. In addition, dltrace does not rely on rtld
[T] symbols to retrieve library and symbol information and is capable of
[T] determing function arguments dynamically via run-time disassembly.
