[I] GNU Common Lisp

[T] GCL is one of the oldest Lisp systems still in use, and as such
[T] has served as the basis for large lisp applications when comput-
[T] ers were much more limited than they are today, particularly in
[T] terms of available memory. Considerable effort was therefore
[T] made in the past to keep the memory image as small as possible.
