[I] A semantic parser of source files

[T] Sparse is a semantic parser of source files. It's neither a compiler
[T] (although it could be used as a front-end for one) nor a preprocessor
[T] (although it contains a preprocessing phase). It is meant to be a small,
[T] simple, easy to use library. Its function is to create a semantic parse
[T] tree for some arbitrary user for further analysis. It's not a tokenizer,
[T] nor is it a generic context-free parser. Context (semantics) is what
[T] it's all about: figuring out not just what the grouping of tokens are,
[T] but what the types are that the grouping implies.
