[I] A ROM update utility (RUU) for HTC devices

[T] HTCFlasher (formerly known as HERMflasher) is a tool which allows you
[T] to flash ROMs on most current HTC devices. It has some extra features
[T] that the original HTC RUU doesn't have. For example, it can present a
[T] serial prompt to the bootloader (replacing mtty), or it can dump NBH
[T] file contents (.nb ROM parts).
