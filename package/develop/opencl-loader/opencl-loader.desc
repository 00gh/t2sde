[I] OpenCL ICD Loader

[T] OpenCL defines an Installable Client Driver (ICD) mechanism to allow
[T] developers to build applications against an Installable Client Driver
[T] loader, rather than linking their applications against a specific OpenCL
[T] implementation. The ICD Loader is responsible for: Exporting OpenCL API
[T] entry points, Enumerating OpenCL implementations, Forwarding OpenCL API
[T] calls to the correct implementation.
