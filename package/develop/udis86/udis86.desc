[I] Disassembler Library for x86 and x86-64

[T] Udis86 is a disassembler for the x86 and x86-64 class of instruction set
[T] architectures. It consists of a C library called libudis86 which provides
[T] a clean and simple interface to decode and inspect a stream of raw binary
[T] data as disassembled instructions in a structured manner, and a command
[T] line tool called udcli that incorporates the library.
