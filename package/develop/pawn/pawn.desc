[I] A simple, typeless, 32-bit extension language with a C-like syntax

[T] A Small "source" program is compiled to a binary file for optimal execution
[T] speed. The Small compiler outputs P-code (or bytecode) that subsequently
[T] runs on an abstract machine. Execution speed, stability, simplicity and a
[T] small footprint were essential design criteria for both the language and
[T] the abstract machine.
