[I] Rebootless Linux kernel security updates

[T] Ksplice allows system administrators to apply security patches to the
[T] Linux kernel without having to reboot. Ksplice takes as input a source
[T] code change in unified diff format and the kernel source code to be
[T] patched, and it applies the patch to the corresponding running kernel.
[T] The running kernel does not need to have been prepared in advance in
[T] any way.
