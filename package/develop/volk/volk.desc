[I] Meta loader for Vulkan API

[T] Volk is a meta-loader for Vulkan. It allows you to dynamically load
[T] entrypoints required to use Vulkan without linking to vulkan-1.dll or
[T] statically linking Vulkan loader. Additionally, Volk simplifies the use
[T] of Vulkan extensions by automatically loading all associated entrypoints.
[T] Finally, volk enables loading Vulkan entrypoints directly from the driver
[T] which can increase performance by skipping loader dispatch overhead.
