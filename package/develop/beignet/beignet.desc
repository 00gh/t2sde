[I] An open source implementation of the OpenCL specification

[T] Beignet is an open source implementation of the OpenCL specification - a
[T] generic compute oriented API. This code base contains the code to run
[T] OpenCL programs on Intel GPUs which basically defines and implements the
[T] OpenCL host functions required to initialize the device, create the
[T] command queues, the kernels and the programs and run them on the GPU.
