[I] A comprehensive, modular, and portable cryptographic toolkit

[T] LibTomCrypt is a comprehensive, modular, and portable cryptographic
[T] toolkit that provides developers with a vast array of well known
[T] published block ciphers, one-way hash functions, chaining modes,
[T] pseudo-random number generators, public key cryptography, and a
[T] plethora of other routines. It has been designed from the ground up
[T] to be very simple to use. It has a modular and standard API that
[T] allows new ciphers, hashes, and PRNGs to be added or removed without
[T] change to the overall end application. It features easy to use
[T] functions and a complete user manual which has many source snippet
[T] examples.
