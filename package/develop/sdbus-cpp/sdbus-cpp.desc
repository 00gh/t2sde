[I] High-level C++ D-Bus library on top of sd-bus

[T] sdbus-c++ is a high-level C++ D-Bus library designed to provide expressive,
[T] easy-to-use API in modern C++. It adds another layer of abstraction on top
[T] of sd-bus. Even though sdbus-c++ uses sd-bus library, it is not necessarily
[T] constrained to systemd and can perfectly be used in non-systemd
[T] environments as well.
