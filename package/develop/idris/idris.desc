[I] A Language for Type-Driven Development

[T] Idris is a programming language designed to encourage Type-Driven
[T] Development.
[T]
[T] In type-driven development, types are tools for constructing programs. We
[T] treat the type as the plan for a program, and use the compiler and type
[T] checker as our assistant, guiding us to a complete program that satisfies
[T] the type.
