[I] Interpreted, object-oriented programming language with a syntax similar to C

[T] Pike is an interpreted, object-oriented, dynamic programming language
[T] with a syntax similar to C. It includes a powerful modules system that,

[T] passes and has powerful built-in data types allowing simple and fast
[T] data manipulation.
