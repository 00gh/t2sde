[I] A cross-platform, open-source make system

[T] CMake is used to control the software compilation process using simple
[T] platform and compiler independent configuration files. CMake generates
[T] native makefiles and workspaces that can be used in the compiler
[T] environment of your choice. CMake is quite sophisticated: it is possible
[T] to support complex environments requiring system configuration,
[T] preprocessor generation, code generation, and template instantiation.
