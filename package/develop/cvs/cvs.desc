[I] A version control system

[T] CVS is a version control system, which allows you to keep old versions
[T] of files (usually source code), keep a log of who, when, and why
[T] changes occurred, etc., like RCS or SCCS. It handles multiple
[T] developers, multiple directories, triggers to enable/log/control
[T] various operations, and can work over a wide area network. The
[T] following tasks are not included; they can be done in conjunction with
[T] CVS but will tend to require some script-writing and software other
[T] than CVS: bug-tracking, build management (that is, make and make-like
[T] tools), and automated testing.
