[I] A Mail Tranfer Agent

[T] Exim is a message transfer agent (MTA) developed at the University of
[T] Cambridge for use on Unix systems connected to the Internet.
[T]
[T] In style it is similar to Smail 3, but its facilities are more extensive,
[T] and in particular it has some defences against mail bombs and unsolicited
[T] junk mail in the form of options for refusing messages from particular
[T] hosts, networks, or senders.
[T]
[T] Compared with sendmail it is much easier to configure, too ;-)!
