[I] A Webmail server using maildirs

[T] SqWebMail is the Webmail module that's bundled with the Courier
[T] mail server. It can also be packaged separately and used with any
[T] other mail server that uses maildirs. SqWebMail does support
[T] traditional Mailbox files, only Maildirs. It accesses maildirs
[T] directly, and does not use an IMAP server.
