[I] Composable all-in-one mail server

[T] Maddy Mail Server implements all functionality required to run a e-mail
[T] server. It can send messages via SMTP (works as MTA), accept messages via
[T] SMTP (works as MX) and store messages while providing access to them via
[T] IMAP. In addition to that it implements auxiliary protocols that are
[T] mandatory to keep email reasonably secure (DKIM, SPF, DMARC, DANE,
[T] MTA-STS).
