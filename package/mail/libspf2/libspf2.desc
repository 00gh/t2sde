[I] Implements the Sender Policy Framework

[T] libspf2 implements the Sender Policy Framework, a part of the SPF/SRS
[T] protocol pair. libspf2 is a library which allows email systems such as
[T] Sendmail, Postfix, Exim, Zmailer and MS Exchange to check SPF records and
[T] make sure that the email is authorized by the domain name that it is coming
[T] from. This prevents email forgery, commonly used by spammers, scammers and
[T] email viruses/worms.
