[I] Content Scanner for Qmail

[T] Qmail-Scanner is an add-on that enables a Qmail e-mail server to scan all
[T] gateway-ed e-mail for certain characteristics (i.e. a content scanner). It is
[T] typically used for its anti-virus protection functions, in which case it is
[T] used in conjunction with external virus scanners. but also enables a site (at a
[T] server/site level) to react to e-mail that contains specific strings in
[T] particular headers, or particular attachment filenames or types (e.g. *.VBS
[T] attachments). It also can be used as an archiving tool for auditing or backup
[T] purposes. Qmail-Scanner is integrated into the mail server at a lower level
[T] than some other Unix-based virus scanners, resulting in better performance. It
[T] is capable of scanning not only locally sent/received e-mail, but also e-mail
[T] that crosses the server in a relay capacity.
[T]
[T] This is a patched version (ergo unofficial) of qmail-scanner, that adds some
[T] options focused in deal with spam and others features.
[T]
[T] Salvatore Toribio modified the code of qmail-scanner with the patch from Chris
[T] Hine to block (quarantine) spam, based in the score of SpamAssassin, most of
[T] the users don't know how to filter messages tagged as spam, and later he added
[T] some other little functionalities.
