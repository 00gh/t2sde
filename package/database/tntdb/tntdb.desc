[I] A C++ class library for database-independent database access

[T] Tntdb is a c++-class-library for database access. It implements a
[T] database-independent layer, which loads the actual driver dynamically
[T] when a connection is made. The classes use automatic resource
[T] management with reference counts. Resources are freed when the classes
[T] go out of scope. Error handling is done with exceptions (derived from
[T] std::exception). There are STL-like iterators for result sets and rows,
[T] and also the cursor is an STL-like iterator. It is written in standard
[T] C++ with Linux. Drivers for PostgreSQL, sqlite3, and MySQL are available.
