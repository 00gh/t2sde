[I] Minimalistic C client for Redis >= 1.2

[T] Hiredis is a minimalistic C client library for the Redis database. It is
[T] minimalistic because it just adds minimal support for the protocol, but at
[T] the same time it uses a high level printf-alike API in order to make it
[T] much higher level than otherwise suggested by its minimal code base and the
[T] lack of explicit bindings for every Redis command.
