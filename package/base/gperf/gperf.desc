[I] GNU Perfect Hash Function

[T] GNU gperf is a perfect hash function generator. For a given list of
[T] strings, it produces a hash function and hash table, in form of C or C++
[T] code, for looking up a value depending on the input string. The hash
[T] function is perfect, which means that the hash table has no collisions,
[T] and the hash table lookup needs a single string comparison only.
[T]
[T] GNU gperf is highly customizable. There are options for generating C or
[T] C++ code, for emitting switch statements or nested ifs instead of a
[T] hash table, and for tuning the algorithm employed by gperf.
