[I] Blingful TUIs and character graphics

[T] A library facilitating complex TUIs on modern terminal emulators,
[T] supporting vivid colors, multimedia, threads, and Unicode to the
[T] maximum degree possible. Things can be done with Notcurses that
[T] simply can't be done with NCURSES. It is furthermore fast as shit.
