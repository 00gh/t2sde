[I] GNU core utilities

[T] These are the GNU core utilities. This package is the union of
[T] the GNU fileutils, sh-utils, and textutils packages.
[T]
[T] Most of these programs have significant advantages over their Unix
[T] counterparts, such as greater speed, additional options, and fewer
[T] arbitrary limits.
[T]
[T] These programs are intended to be POSIX.2 compliant (with BSD and other
[T] extensions), like the rest of the GNU system.
