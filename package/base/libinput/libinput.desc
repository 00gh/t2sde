[I] A library to handle input devices

[T] libinput is a library to handle input devices in Wayland compositors and
[T] to provide a generic X.Org input driver. It provides device detection,
[T] device handling, input device event processing and abstraction so minimize
[T] the amount of custom input code compositors need to provide the common
[T] set of functionality that users expect.
